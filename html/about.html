                <p>ML Strength are Australia's newest brand in health and fitness, with gyms opening throughout the Brisbane metropolitan area. ML Strength believes fitness comes first and keeping fit and improving your health is not just a fad - it's a way of life. Whether your goal is weight loss, body building, nutrition or diet improvements, having more energy, or just looking and feeling better. We have created gyms that we would love to train in and share that passion and enthusiasm with our valued members. Our gyms have an old school feel with a new school attitude! </p>
